# Hello there!

Our vision is very much to be as privacy-friendly as possible and to collect as little data as possible. Read our full story to better understand our goals and get to know us. ðŸ˜Š

## The beginning 

So in the beginning of 2022 I started to looking for Website protections that can protect my service and hide the IP address of my server without being able to see in the traffic. To my surprise, I couldn't find a single one. Most protection services issue their own certificates, thus completely breaking the real End-to-End encryption. So I thought I could create a service where I can provide security services in a way that didn't violate privacy and make it virtually impossible for me to see your traffic.

I started the project completely on my own, but quickly realised that it was a much bigger project than I had originally thought, and I simply couldn't have gone as fast as I wanted to on my own.

## Becoming a team

The solo development of Proxyma Cloud has ended and a team has been formed.

By the beginning of 2024, we are a full team and we have more people working on the service, which will strongly contribute to the progress of the project. Our team came up with a lot of new ideas, so we quickly realised that there was another big problem, but now in the Gaming World. It's incredibly expensive to find a decent Minecraft Protection service that's usable and rich in features. So we came up with a number of solutions and after a lot of thought, we decided to start working on Minecraft as well as Web protection. Proxyma Cloud aims to provide you with better, cheaper and hopefully free solutions. We don't want to be just an average company, we want to provide a service that everyone is happy to use.

## Goals and Roadmap

Our service is currently in a very early state and unfortunately not yet ready for publication, but we are working hard to open our gates as soon as possible.

First, we want to launch our Minecraft protection so that anyone can run a stable and secure server from a cheap VPS or even from home. Unfortunately there are a lot of bad people out there and DDoS attacks are the most primitive but most damaging method for a service. That's why we're focusing on DDoS Protection first, once we're done with that we'll start implementing various useful features in our service that hopefully everyone can benefit from.

After that we will start to focus on Web protection. Of course, in order to maintain privacy, we will not be able to provide caching services or CDN solutions, but that is not our goal. Our goal is to hide the IP address of your server, its location and all this in a way that we don't have the possibility to see your traffic. Your server, your data.

What does the future hold? That's our little secret, but I promise you, we have lots of plans.ðŸ˜‰
